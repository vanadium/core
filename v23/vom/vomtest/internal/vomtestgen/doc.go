Command vomtestgen generates test cases for the vomtest package.  The following
file is generated:

   pass81_gen.vdl - Golden file containing passing test cases for version 81.

Do not run this tool manually.  Instead invoke it via:
   $ go generate v.io/v23/vom/vomtest

Usage:
   vomtestgen [flags]

The global flags are:
 -alsologtostderr=true
   log to standard error as well as files
 -log_backtrace_at=:0
   when logging hits line file:N, emit a stack trace
 -log_dir=
   if non-empty, write log files to this directory
 -logtostderr=false
   log to standard error instead of files
 -max_stack_buf_size=4292608
   max size in bytes of the buffer to use for logging stack traces
 -metadata=<just specify -metadata to activate>
   Displays metadata for the program and exits.
 -stderrthreshold=2
   logs at or above this threshold go to stderr
 -time=false
   Dump timing information to stderr before exiting the program.
 -v=0
   log level for V logs
 -vdltest=
   Filter vdltest.All to only return entries that contain the given substring.
   If the value starts with "!", only returns entries that don't contain the
   given substring.
 -vmodule=
   comma-separated list of globpattern=N settings for filename-filtered logging
   (without the .go suffix).  E.g. foo/bar/baz.go is matched by patterns baz or
   *az or b* but not by bar/baz or baz.go or az or b.*
 -vpath=
   comma-separated list of regexppattern=N settings for file pathname-filtered
   logging (without the .go suffix).  E.g. foo/bar/baz.go is matched by patterns
   foo/bar/baz or fo.*az or oo/ba or b.z but not by foo/bar/baz.go or fo*az
