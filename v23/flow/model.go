// Package flow defines interfaces for the management of authenticated bidirectional byte Flows.
// TODO(suharshs): This is a work in progress and can change without notice.
//
// A Flow represents a flow-controlled authenticated byte stream between two endpoints.
//
// A Manager manages the creation of Flows and the re-use of network connections.
// A Manager can Dial out to a specific remote end to receive a Flow to that end.
// A Manager can Listen on multiple protocols and addresses. Listening
// causes the Manager to accept flows from any of the specified protocols and addresses.
// Additionally a Manager will accept incoming Dialed out connections for their lifetime.
