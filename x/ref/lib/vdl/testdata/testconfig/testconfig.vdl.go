// initializeVDL performs vdl initialization.  It is safe to call multiple times.
// If you have an init ordering issue, just insert the following line verbatim
// into your source files in this package, right after the "package foo" clause:
//
//    var _ = initializeVDL()
//
// The purpose of this function is to ensure that vdl initialization occurs in
// the right order, and very early in the init sequence.  In particular, vdl
// registration and package variable initialization needs to occur before
// functions like vdl.TypeOf will work properly.
//
// This function returns a dummy value, so that it can be used to initialize the
// first var in the file, to take advantage of Go's defined init order.
