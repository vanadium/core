package nativedep2

// The purpose of this test is to ensure that the generated file gets the
// imports right.  In particular, the generated file has no code dependencies on
// nativetest, but should have two imports:
//     "time"
//   _ "v.io/x/ref/lib/vdl/testdata/nativetest"
//
// The underscore dependency is added to ensure that nativetest.WireTime is
// registered whenever this package is used, so that the WireTime<->time.Time
// mapping is known by the vdl package.
