Command gcreds runs a command with Google Cloud Blessings.

The Google Cloud credentials can be specified with the --key-file flag. If
--key-file is not set, the default credentials will be used. These credentials
are exchanged for Vanadium blessings using the OAuthBlesser service specified
with the --oauth-blesser flag.

The command is executed with an ephemeral principal that has the blessings
received from the OAuthBlesser service. The principal and its blessings are held
in memory and do not persist after gcreds exits.

See
https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials
for more information on Google Cloud credentials.

Usage:
   gcreds [flags] <command>

The gcreds flags are:
 -key-file=
   The JSON file containing the Google Cloud credentials to use. If empty, the
   default credentials will be used.
 -oauth-blesser=https://dev.v.io/auth/google/bless
   The URL of the OAuthBlesser service.

The global flags are:
 -alsologtostderr=true
   log to standard error as well as files
 -log_backtrace_at=:0
   when logging hits line file:N, emit a stack trace
 -log_dir=
   if non-empty, write log files to this directory
 -logtostderr=false
   log to standard error instead of files
 -max_stack_buf_size=4292608
   max size in bytes of the buffer to use for logging stack traces
 -metadata=<just specify -metadata to activate>
   Displays metadata for the program and exits.
 -stderrthreshold=2
   logs at or above this threshold go to stderr
 -time=false
   Dump timing information to stderr before exiting the program.
 -v=0
   log level for V logs
 -v23.credentials=

 -v23.namespace.root=[/(dev.v.io:r:vprod:service:mounttabled)@ns.dev.v.io:8101]
   local namespace root; can be repeated to provided multiple roots
 -v23.permissions.file=map[]
   specify a perms file as <name>:<permsfile>
 -v23.permissions.literal=

   address to listen on
 -v23.tcp.protocol=wsh

   collection.
 -v23.vtrace.dump-on-shutdown=true
   If true, dump all stored traces on runtime shutdown.
 -v23.vtrace.sample-rate=0
   Rate (from 0.0 to 1.0) to sample vtrace traces.
 -v23.vtrace.v=0
   The verbosity level of the log messages to be captured in traces
 -vmodule=
   comma-separated list of globpattern=N settings for filename-filtered logging
   (without the .go suffix).  E.g. foo/bar/baz.go is matched by patterns baz or
   *az or b* but not by bar/baz or baz.go or az or b.*
 -vpath=
   comma-separated list of regexppattern=N settings for file pathname-filtered
