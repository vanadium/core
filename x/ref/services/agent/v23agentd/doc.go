Command v23agentd manages the security agent daemon, which holds the private
key, blessings and recognized roots of a principal in memory and makes the
principal available to other processes.

Other processes can access the agent credentials when V23_AGENT_PATH is set to
<credential dir>/agent/sock.

Without arguments, v23agentd starts the agent to exclusively serve the specified
credentials.

Exits right away if another agent is already serving the credentials. Exits when
there are no processes accessing the credentials (after a grace period).

Example:
 $ v23agentd --credentials=$HOME/.credentials
 $ V23_AGENT_PATH=$HOME/.credentials/agent/sock principal dump

Usage:
   v23agentd [flags]
   v23agentd [flags] <command>

The v23agentd commands are:
   stop        Stops the agent
   help        Display help for commands or topics

The v23agentd flags are:
 -create=false
   Whether to create the credentials if missing.
 -credentials=
   Credentials directory.  Defaults to the V23_CREDENTIALS environment variable.
 -daemon=true
   Run the agent as a daemon (returns right away but leaves the agent running in
   the background)
 -timeout=0s
   How long the agent stays alive without any client connections. Zero implies
   no timeout.
 -with-version=0
   Version that the agent should use.  Will fail if the version is not in the
   range of supported versions (obtained from the --metadata flag)

The global flags are:
 -alsologtostderr=true
   log to standard error as well as files
 -log_backtrace_at=:0
   when logging hits line file:N, emit a stack trace
 -log_dir=
   if non-empty, write log files to this directory
 -logtostderr=false
   log to standard error instead of files
 -max_stack_buf_size=4292608
   max size in bytes of the buffer to use for logging stack traces
 -metadata=<just specify -metadata to activate>
   Displays metadata for the program and exits.
 -stderrthreshold=2
   logs at or above this threshold go to stderr
 -time=false
   Dump timing information to stderr before exiting the program.
 -v=0
   log level for V logs
 -vmodule=
   comma-separated list of globpattern=N settings for filename-filtered logging
   (without the .go suffix).  E.g. foo/bar/baz.go is matched by patterns baz or
   *az or b* but not by bar/baz or baz.go or az or b.*
 -vpath=
   comma-separated list of regexppattern=N settings for file pathname-filtered
   logging (without the .go suffix).  E.g. foo/bar/baz.go is matched by patterns
   foo/bar/baz or fo.*az or oo/ba or b.z but not by foo/bar/baz.go or fo*az
