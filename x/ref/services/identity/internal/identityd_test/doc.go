Command identityd_test runs a daemon HTTP server that uses OAuth to create
security.Blessings objects.

Starts a test version of the identityd server that mocks out oauth, auditing,
and revocation.

To generate TLS certificates so the HTTP server can use SSL:
  go run $(go list -f {{.Dir}} "crypto/tls")/generate_cert.go --host <IP address>

Usage:
   identityd_test [flags]

The identityd_test flags are:
 -assets-prefix=
   Host serving the web assets for the identity server.
 -browser=false
   Whether to open a browser caveat selector.
 -discharger-location=
   The name of the discharger service. May be rooted. If empty, the published
   name is used.
 -external-http-addr=
   External address on which the HTTP server listens on.  If none is provided
   the server will only listen on -http-addr.
 -http-addr=localhost:0
   Address on which the HTTP server listens on.
 -mount-prefix=identity
   Mount name prefix to use.  May be rooted.
 -oauth-credentials-dir=
   Path to the credentials to use for the oauth http handler.
 -oauth-email=testemail@example.com
   Username for the mock oauth to put in the returned blessings.
 -remote-signer-blessing-dir=
   Path to the blessings to use with the remote signer. Use the empty string to
   disable the remote signer.
 -remote-signer-o-blessing-dir=
   Path to the blessings to use with the remote signer for oauth. Use the empty
   string to disable the remote signer.
 -tls-config=
   Comma-separated list of TLS certificate and private key files, in that order.
   This must be provided.

The global flags are:
 -alsologtostderr=true
   log to standard error as well as files
 -log_backtrace_at=:0
   when logging hits line file:N, emit a stack trace
 -log_dir=
   if non-empty, write log files to this directory
 -logtostderr=false
   log to standard error instead of files
 -max_stack_buf_size=4292608
   max size in bytes of the buffer to use for logging stack traces
 -metadata=<just specify -metadata to activate>
   Displays metadata for the program and exits.
 -stderrthreshold=2
   logs at or above this threshold go to stderr
 -time=false
   Dump timing information to stderr before exiting the program.
 -v=0
   log level for V logs

   if set the process will also advertise its private addresses
 -v23.virtualized.disallow-native-fallback=false
   if set, a failure to detect the requested virtualization provider will result
   in an error, otherwise, native mode is used

   if set the process will use the supplied dns name (and port) without
   resolution for its entry in the mounttable
 -v23.virtualized.docker=
   set if the process is running in a docker container and needs to configure
   itself differently therein
 -v23.virtualized.provider=
   the name of the virtualization/cloud provider hosting this process if the
