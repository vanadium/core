Command identityd_test runs a daemon HTTP server that uses OAuth to create
security.Blessings objects.

Starts a test version of the identityd server that mocks out oauth, auditing,
and revocation.

To generate TLS certificates so the HTTP server can use SSL:
  go run $(go list -f {{.Dir}} "crypto/tls")/generate_cert.go --host <IP address>

Usage:
   identityd_test [flags]

The identityd_test flags are:
 -assets-prefix=
   Host serving the web assets for the identity server.
 -browser=false
   Whether to open a browser caveat selector.
 -discharger-location=
   The name of the discharger service. May be rooted. If empty, the published
   name is used.
 -external-http-addr=
   External address on which the HTTP server listens on.  If none is provided
   the server will only listen on -http-addr.
 -http-addr=localhost:0
   Address on which the HTTP server listens on.
 -mount-prefix=identity
   Mount name prefix to use.  May be rooted.
 -oauth-credentials-dir=
   Path to the credentials to use for the oauth http handler.
 -oauth-email=testemail@example.com
   Username for the mock oauth to put in the returned blessings.
 -remote-signer-blessing-dir=
   Path to the blessings to use with the remote signer. Use the empty string to
   disable the remote signer.
 -remote-signer-o-blessing-dir=
   Path to the blessings to use with the remote signer for oauth. Use the empty
   string to disable the remote signer.
 -tls-config=
   Comma-separated list of TLS certificate and private key files, in that order.
   This must be provided.

The global flags are:
 -alsologtostderr=true

 -log_backtrace_at=:0
   when logging hits line file:N, emit a stack trace
 -log_dir=
   if non-empty, write log files to this directory
 -logtostderr=false
   log to standard error instead of files
 -max_stack_buf_size=4292608
   max size in bytes of the buffer to use for logging stack traces
 -metadata=<just specify -metadata to activate>
   Displays metadata for the program and exits.
 -stderrthreshold=2
   logs at or above this threshold go to stderr
 -time=false
   Dump timing information to stderr before exiting the program.
 -v=0
   log level for V logs
 -v23.credentials=

   policy for choosing from a set of available proxy instances
 -v23.tcp.address=
   address to listen on
 -v23.tcp.protocol=
   protocol to listen with
 -v23.virtualized.advertise-private-addresses=
   if set the process will also advertise its private addresses
 -v23.virtualized.disallow-native-fallback=false
   if set, a failure to detect the requested virtualization provider will result
   in an error, otherwise, native mode is used
 -v23.virtualized.dns.public-name=
   if set the process will use the supplied dns name (and port) without
   resolution for its entry in the mounttable
 -v23.virtualized.docker=
   set if the process is running in a docker container and needs to configure
   itself differently therein
 -v23.virtualized.provider=
   the name of the virtualization/cloud provider hosting this process if the
